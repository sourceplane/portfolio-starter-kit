# The phases in `repo-blueprint.yaml` must be the phases the bootstrap runs,
# placing what they are meant to place, saying what they are, and naming only
# what the engine can resolve.
#
# The partition below is the bootstrap's order, written down a second time on
# purpose: the order is load-bearing (the deployment record cannot be written
# before the site is live), and a module that drifts into another phase fails
# at landing time, live, with nothing in this repository having looked wrong.
# Moving one is a deliberate change, argued in the diff that edits both places.
#
# ONE LANDING BUILDS THE SITE (PK-6, cirrus-baseline baseline-v22's shape):
# 01-product places every module, and 03-docs only records.
#
# And the shape that keeps a bootstrap fast (orun >= v2.88.0, turso-starter
# baseline-v8's): the run-level task set-up runs in the background, each
# phase finds its task just before its landing, each landing checks its
# commit here (`checks: local`), and the convergence watch reads every few
# seconds.
#
# Adapted from sourceplane/cirrus-baseline's testing/phases.test.sh: the
# narration rules and the hook-only rule are Cirrus's, unchanged.

# bash + python3 + PyYAML. No network, no fakes, no credential.
